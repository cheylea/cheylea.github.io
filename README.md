# Author Notes
This is the repositiory for my personal GitHub pages website. I started this project a long time ago when becoming a Computer Science student, as it seemed like a standard for anyone in technology to have their own website. The trouble is, I am a back end coder and do not take well to front end code. However, determined, I plowed ahead.

At first I was very against wanting to learn JavaScript, and spend a lot of time coming up with ways to do what I wanted to do with pure CSS. However eventually I caved in order to get the site looking exactly how I liked, and after using javascript out of necessity for my dissertation project. Another feature of this site is not a sacrifice of things I actually like for the sake of boring typical backgrounds and colours associated with computer science. There is such diversity in this field and breaking stereotypes is the goal!

This site got abandonned many times whilst working on my degree, moving house, and other hardship - but it is done! For a much more fleshed out and impressive example of site building skills please see my dissertation project which will be made public May 2024. But as for this site, it is not perfect, but we can't let perfection be the enemy of good.
