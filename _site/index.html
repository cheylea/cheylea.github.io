         <img src="static/images/profilepicture.jpg" alt="Profile picture of Cheylea Hopkinson" >
         <p>Hi! I'm the Principal Data Architect for Southampton City Council (SCC), running a team to deliver robust data marts to all services across the city and supporting research work as part of the <a href = "https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/support/health-determinants-research-collaborations.htm" target="_blank">Health Determinants Research Collaborations</a>. I have previously led the data team for Adult Social Care at SCC and I've worked on various data-related projects throughout my time at the council and across my career.</p>
         <p>My speciality is shaping and growing company-wide reporting to drive business decisions using an evidence-based data approach. To execute this, I work with stakeholders to understand what type of evidence can aid and empower people with data.</p>
         <p>Having had the opportunity to work on interesting projects throughout my career, I've worked on various flavours of data projects. This includes building datamarts, working on classification machine learning algorithms and partnering with colleagues to deliver a single source of truth for council-wide key performance indicators.</p>
         <p>Continual learning and self-improvement is my passion, from self-teaching SQL in a week when I decided I wanted to be an analyst to recently completing my master's degree in Computer Science with a Distinction from the University of Liverpool. This has allowed me to delve into code deeper than I ever thought I could - and I recently completed my dissertation project looking at a blockchain method for electronic voting.</p>
         <p>Mathematics was my chosen subject at undergrad, and I favoured number theory, algorithm design and statistics - using many of these concepts daily.</p>
         <p>In short, I love getting stuck in to a new challenge and am content as long as I get to use my skills to solve cool problems.</p>

                    <h2>Education at University of Liverpool, 2024</h2>
                    <p>Studying for a Masters in Computer Science covering various topics such as Software Development in Practice, Machine Learning and Emerging Trends. All modules strongly emphasise examining the social, ethical and legal implications of developing various technologies.</p>
                    <p>I recently completed my dissertation research into electronic voting, which involves exploring solutions to the problem in the UK by producing software, running simulations and researching the ethical impacts. I surveyed for the project and developed an <a href="https://selfverificationelectronicvotingtool-che159250.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank">electronic voting tool</a> using Python, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. </p>
                    <p>The degree has included peer-to-peer discussion work and individual and group projects. From essays to software to video projects.</p>
                    <p>Acheived distinction grade in May 2024.</p>

                <div id="tando" style="display: none;">
                    <h2>Work Experience at Tando, 2021</h2>
                    <p>While working for Tando, I started as a Data Analyst and Project Manager and soon took on the extra role of Head of Teach and lead for the 5-person tech team.</p>
                    <p>My role as Data Analyst was primarily building and managing business-wide reporting for stakeholders to create visibility across channels (SQL, Power Query and Power BI).</p>
                    <p>My Project Manager role involved writing up technical specifications for projects, translating to business requirements required by the business, and working directly with developers to execute them, often with swift turnarounds, working across several time zones.</p>
                    <p>The Head of Tech role included running the daily stand-ups, ticket organisation and delegation for developers, and working Agilely using Azure DevOps.</p>

                <div id="cl" style="display: none;">
                  <h2>Work Experience at ClearLoans, 2020</h2>
                  <p>ClearLoans was my first Data Analyst role and involved building the reporting for the whole business in Power BI, alongside using SQL in Microsoft Azure Data Factory. Reporting consisted of various areas such as payout and collections information.</p>
                  <p>Whilst at ClearLoans, took on many analysis projects such as creating an income analysis algorithm for accurately capturing an applicant's income, a bank statement transaction classification model using machine learning and a credit risk-weighted scorecard to identify customers likely to default on their loans.</p>
                  <p>All projects involved close collaboration with developers to implement models into production and thinking outside the box with limited resources.</p>

               <div id="onefeed" style="display: none;">
                  <h2>Work Experience at Onefeed, 2018</h2>
                  <p>My first role after graduation was as an Account Manager for over ten clients, devising marketing strategies for the Pay-Per-Click Google Shopping and Bing Shopping campaigns and monitoring product feeds for errors and data quality. The role involved regular performance analysis, including using Google Analytics and working directly with clients to understand their products.</p>
                  <p>Whilst working at Onefeed completed various exams, including Adwords Fundamentals, Shopping and Search exams and Bing Shopping. Here, I developed my Excel skills and began to foster an interest in SQL when working with the developers. I also took on the additional role of admin assistant, producing employee documents and training guides to assist with onboarding.</p>

                  <h2>Education at Royal Holloway, 2017</h2>
                  <p>At Royal Holloway, I studied for an undergraduate degree in Mathematics, studying various topics such as Statistics, Number Theory, Algorithm Design and Combinatorics. Overall, I built a strong knowledge base in Mathematics, as well as learning areas of application to real life and developing skills such as self-management and group collaboration</p>
                  <p>Whilst at university, was involved in many societies, including being Musical Director for on-site a cappella choir <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjrQdwYidZI" target="_blank">Absolute Harmony</a> for two years and planning / presenting various radio shows throughout for Insanity Radio, winning Best Presenting Team in 2017 with breakfast show <a href= "https://soundcloud.com/cheylea-hopkinson/cuppa-tea-with-oph-and-me-demo" target="_blank">Cuppa Tea with Oph and Me.</a></p>
