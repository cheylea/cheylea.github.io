<p>Hi! I'm the Principal Data Architect for Southampton City Council (SCC), running a team to deliver robust data marts to all services across the city and supporting research work as part of the <a href = "https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/support/health-determinants-research-collaborations.htm" target="_blank">Health Determinants Research Collaborations</a>. I have previously led the data team for Adult Social Care at SCC and I've worked on various data-related projects throughout my time at the council and across my career.</p>
<p>My speciality is shaping and growing company-wide reporting to drive business decisions using an evidence-based data approach. To execute this, I work with stakeholders to understand what type of evidence can aid and empower people with data.</p>
<p>Having had the opportunity to work on interesting projects throughout my career, I've worked on various flavours of data projects. This includes building datamarts, working on classification machine learning algorithms and partnering with colleagues to deliver a single source of truth for council-wide key performance indicators.</p>
<p>Continual learning and self-improvement is my passion, from self-teaching SQL in a week when I decided I wanted to be an analyst to recently completing my master's degree in Computer Science with a Distinction from the University of Liverpool. This has allowed me to delve into code deeper than I ever thought I could - and I recently completed my dissertation project looking at a blockchain method for electronic voting.</p>
<p>Mathematics was my chosen subject at undergrad, and I favoured number theory, algorithm design and statistics - using many of these concepts daily.</p>
<p>In short, I love getting stuck in to a new challenge and am content as long as I get to use my skills to solve cool problems.</p>
