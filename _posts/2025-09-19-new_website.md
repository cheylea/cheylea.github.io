A very brief blog post to say welcome to the new design of my website! I got struck by inspiration a few months ago to completely redesign and adapt my CV website to combine some of my personal interests alongside my professional.

I'm hoping to expand my blog going forward to include subjects beyond coding and in line with my other interests, such as crochet, performance and more. I have also recently been elected as Secretary for [SOS Presents](https://www.sospresents.org/) and plan to be starting a new job in the New Year - so it's all happening at the moment and I want to document this time in my life.

Stay tuned!

❤️
