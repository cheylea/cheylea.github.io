Note from the author 2024: This is an archived blog from a newsletter I sent to family and friends about my studies, insanely thinking I could somehow keep it up weekly. So take with a pinch of salt! It's interesting to look back on where things were so many years ago, and also how hilariously formal some of these blogs are.
