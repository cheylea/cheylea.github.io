Earlier on in this year I started taking lots of steps to try and improve my mental health and wellbeing. One of these was picking up gratitude journalling. I found it really nice to have a daily ritual of adding something each day to a little phone app and reflecting on the things, however small, I could be grateful for.

What I was NOT grateful for was the cost of the little phone app.

For the freedom of customisation and editing and all sorts of other features, my free trial was over and they were looking to charge something like £70 a annually. This was not something I could justify, but the free version felt so restrictive.

So I thought to myself, hey it really is just a database with a front end. I can make that, easy.
This blog details the process of building my own journal app, and the lessons learned along the way!

Original
================
My original concept was that I wanted it to look and feel like an actual notebook. I wanted each entry to have a page and then not just be the journal entry but have lots of different pieces of information about the day integrated on the page, such as steps and weather.

I put together the following specification
- Three gratitude questions that could be increased/decreased depending on what I wanted as time wore on
- The ability to upload a picture to the entry (optional)
- The entry to capture my total steps for the day, weather, most listening to song / genre and analyse the mood of my entry.
- Have a home page with various graphs and analysis of my entries
- Have the journal send a message to my slim-socials if I hadn't filled it in for the day
- Look like a book and be able to flip through "pages" for each entry

I first started this project back in April 2025, with the anticipation this would be a much shorter project than my Ultimate Flaggle project. It was around this time I began taking lots of steps to improve my health, such as the slim-socials project (see [Slim Socials](blogs/20250422_slim_socials.html)) and also my weight loss journey. However, this definitely became a massive time sink very quickly.
