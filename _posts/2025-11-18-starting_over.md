Earlier on in this year I started taking lots of steps to try and improve my mental health and wellbeing. One of these was picking up gratitude journalling. I found it really nice to have a daily ritual of adding something each day to a little phone app and reflecting on the things, however small, I could be grateful for.

What I was NOT grateful for was the cost of the little phone app.

For the freedom of customisation and editing and all sorts of other features, my free trial was over and they were looking to charge something like £70 a annually. This was not something I could justify, but the free version felt so restrictive.

So I thought to myself, hey it really is just a database with a front end. I can make that, easy.
This blog details the process of building my own journal app, and the lessons learned along the way!
